# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This application runs via the command line using Node.js and the NPM package Inquirer, which provides the functionality to capture a userâ€™s input.  For this app, we utilize Node and Inquirer to create a team roster with questions and answers, and based on the user's input, an all-star roster is dynamically created in HTML5 with a responsive layout using Bootstrap.  Lastly, this app features the Jest framework for unit testing.
